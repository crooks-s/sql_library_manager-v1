# SQL Library Manager
TeamTreehouse Unit 8 Project

This is a Team Treehouse project demonstrating the following skills:
1) Express
2) SQLite3 
3) Pug
4) Sequelize - ORM validation, CLI
6) Database syncing
7) Database modeling
8) CRUD

The goal of this project is to build a web application that demonstrates CRUD operations for a library database. 

Considerations to improve design, UX:
- A _search_ feature was added, but the styling for the feature needs to be done.
- The _pug views_ could also be cleaned up.
- Given a larger databse, implementing _pagination_ would be helpful.
- When a user searches for book, the category searched is not retained upon submit. This can be improved for UX.

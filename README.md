# SQL Library Manager
TeamTreehouse Unit 8 Project

This is a Team Treehouse project demonstrating the following skills:
1) Express
2) SQLite3 
3) Pug
4) Sequelize - ORM validation, CLI
6) Database syncing
7) Database modeling
8) CRUD

The goal of this project is to build a web application that demonstrates CRUD operations for a library database. A search feature was added, but the styling for the feature needs to be done. The views could also be cleaned up. 

Author: Sean Crooks
<br>Contributions: Team Treehouse supplied library.db and style.css, along with the guidelines for the project.
